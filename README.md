## Overview

**OncoView UAE** is an interactive Tableau dashboard built using a **synthetic cancer dataset** representing fictional cases across the **United Arab Emirates (UAE)**. The data is sourced from **Kaggle** and licensed under the **MIT License**.

Cancer is a sensitive public health issue affecting a vulnerable population. This dashboard does **not** make any medical interpretations or provide clinical insights. Instead, it serves as a **technical showcase** of how cancer-related data can be visualized to explore patterns in demographics, diagnosis, treatment timelines, and patient outcomes.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Tableau Public** â€“ For building multi-layered dashboards  
- **Kaggle Dataset** â€“ Synthetic cancer dataset (fictionalized and anonymized)  
- **Calculated Fields & Filters** â€“ For interactive exploration  
- **Story Navigation** â€“ Button-based section navigation within dashboard  
- **Charts** â€“ Line plots, bar charts, maps, boxplots, donut charts, bubble charts

---

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate **data storytelling** through layered Tableau dashboards  
- Explore how a synthetic cancer dataset can be used to simulate **real-world scenarios**  
- Visualize important variables like **age, gender, cancer stage, comorbidities**, and **treatment timelines**  
- Present a **non-clinical**, safe, and ethical representation of sensitive healthcare topics

## Dashboard Sections

1. **Cancer Demographics**  
   Age and gender breakdowns, common cancer types, and nationality analysis

2. **Geographic and Temporal Trends**  
   Trends by Emirate and diagnosis year with choropleth map visualizations

3. **Clinical Characteristics**  
   Treatment types by cancer stage, comorbidities, and stage-at-diagnosis distributions

4. **Treatment Timeliness and Survival Analysis**  
   Time from diagnosis to treatment and survival durations by cancer type

5. **Patient Status**  
   Outcomes across hospitals and most common causes of death

6. **Risk Factors and Lifestyle**  
   Smoking status analysis and impact on cancer diagnosis/outcomes

7. **Body Metrics and Prognosis**  
   BMI and weight distribution of patients segmented by treatment outcomes

## Business Impact

1. **Healthcare Dashboards** â€“ Demonstrates ability to design responsive, filter-driven dashboards for complex clinical data.

2. **Analytical Thinking** â€“ Showcases skill in identifying key variables that affect patient outcomes, without breaching ethical limits.

3. **Data Literacy & Storytelling** â€“ Converts raw data into insights using charts and intuitive navigation for different user personas.

4. **Public Health Readiness** â€“ Provides a sample framework that could be extended for real clinical data systems (with appropriate privacy controls).
